  "description": "Used to calculate what the flat size of material is needed to produce a 'Dispa' folded frame.  User inputs Face width and height dimensions, then how deep the frame is and how big the base of the frame is. They also input the thickness of the material used to make the frame.  Once input the calculator figures out all of the sizes, draws a representation and totals the sizes to get a flat size for estimating cost and material usage. App written in Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS by Dave Winfield, July, 2021. This is Dave's first original working App.",
